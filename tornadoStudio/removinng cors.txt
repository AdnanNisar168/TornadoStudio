In ASP.NET, there is no dedicated "CORS package" to completely remove CORS errors, as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that's built into web browsers and must be configured at the server level. However, you can use ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET Web API to manage CORS settings. The specific package you need depends on whether you're using ASP.NET Core or traditional ASP.NET (MVC).

Here are the commonly used approaches:

### ASP.NET Core:

In ASP.NET Core, you can manage CORS by configuring CORS policies in the `Startup.cs` file. No additional packages are needed, as CORS support is built into ASP.NET Core. You need to add CORS middleware and configure policies as needed.

Here's an example of how to configure CORS in ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
// In Startup.cs
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

// ...

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...

    services.AddCors(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AllowSpecificOrigin",
            builder => builder.WithOrigins("http://your-angular-app-url")
                .AllowAnyMethod()
                .AllowAnyHeader());
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // ...

    app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");

    // ...
}
```

### ASP.NET Web API:

If you are using traditional ASP.NET Web API, you can use the `Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors` package to enable and configure CORS. This package is not required in ASP.NET Core. You can install it using NuGet:

```bash
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors
```

After installing the package, you can configure CORS in your Web API application, as shown in the previous response, by adding CORS attributes to your controllers or using the `config.EnableCors()` method in your WebApiConfig.cs file.

Make sure to adjust the CORS settings to match your specific requirements and security considerations. Always limit CORS access to trusted origins and avoid using wildcards ("*") for production applications.
